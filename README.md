STEPS INVOLVE IN THE INTEGRATING LARAVEL SOCIALITE

FIRSTLY SETUP NEW LARAVEL PROJECT WITH LARAVEL BREEZE

INSTALL LARAVEL SOCIALITE FROM WEBSITE OF LARAVEL

CREATE THREE CONTROLLERS : INDEX , REDIRECT , CALLBACK

INDEX CONTROLLER TAKE TO THE PAGE WHERE OUR HTML GOES

IN OUR LOGIN PAGE WE HAVE BUTTONS TO , LOGIN WITH TWITTER,GOOGLE,FACEBOOK,GITHUB

WHEN WE CLICK ON ANY BUTTON IT GOES ON REDIRECT CONTROLLER WITH PARAMENTER(SERVICE) .. LIKE YOU LOGIN WITH GITHUB IT GOES TO REDIRECT CONTROLLER WITH PARAM OF GITHUB . IT REDIRECT US TO WEBSITE OF OUR SERVICE WHERE WE CONTINUE AND FROM WHERE WHEN USER IS AUTHENTICATED IT GOES TO CALLBACK CONTROLLER 

FOR SETTING UP SERVICES WE SET UP CLIENT ID AND CLIENT SECRET IN .ENV FILE AND REGISTERED THEM IN OUR CONFIG/SERVICES.PHP

NOW WE CREATE A FACTORY CREATEUSERFACTORY WHICH BASICALLY CHECKS OUR SERVICE AND CALL FROM WHICH SERVICE WE TRY TO LOGIN

WE HAVE A ACTIONS FOLDER INSIDE IT THEIR IS A SOCIAL FOLDER INSIDE IT WE HAVE A CONTRATCS FOLDER THAT CONTAIN OUR INTERFACE 
AND WE IMPLEMENTS THIS INTEFACE WITH ALL THE SOCIAL LOGIN WEBSITES WE USED . 

WE CREATE COLUMN FOR EACH SERVICE AND BY DEFAULT THESE ARE NULLABE LIKE FOR GIT HUB WE ADDED COLUMN OF GITHUB_ID IN USERS TABLE

WHICH SERVICE IS CALLED , OUR FACTORY REDIRECT US TO THAT ACTION AND SERVICE CLASS(ie:GITHUB) IT RETURNS US A USER USING A METHOD OF firstOrCreate 

NOW IN OUR CALLBACK CONTROLLER WE CALL OUR FACTORY AND PASS OUR SERVICE SO FACTORY CHECK THE SERVICE AND CALL THE SPECIFIC ACTION

AT THE END IT REDIRECTS US TO OUR HOME PAGE(DASHBOARD)

// ADITIONALLY WE ADDED A CONDITION OF CHECKING EMAIL AND SET UP PASSWORD IF WE LOGIN FROM ANY SERVICE OUR PASSWORD IS NULL WE MADE A FUNCTION WHICH CHECK IF PASSWORD IS NULL WE CAN ADD NEW PASSWORD FROM PROFILE ELSE WE CHANGE PASSWORD AS OF OUR DEFAULT METHOD
